This script adds the functionality to toggle blackbars on the screen in RedM. When activated, blackbars are 
displayed at the top and bottom of the screen, creating a cinematic effect. Simply use the /blackbars command 
to toggle the blackbars on and off.

How to:
- Download the steff-blackbars script.
- Drag the script into your RedM server's resources folder.
- Ensure the script is started in your server.cfg.
  
In-game, use the /blackbars command to toggle the blackbars on and off.
